- when size of content array gets too big, we should increase block size and rewrite the whole file
- -Wall
- consider big files -> use 64 bit variables?
- handle addToDynArray failures
(at this point we should have working MVP -- with local destination and no encryption
- optimization: use read cache so we don't download and decrypt the same blocks multiple times
- improve local destination by applying a filesystem hook to be notified about changes in the filesystem
- s3 destination
- implement tests
- implement undo actions
