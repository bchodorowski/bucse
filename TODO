- research how fuse program should work with Uid/Gid priviledges
- ssh destination
- be able to read the passphrase from the terminal input
- rename bucse to bucse-mount
- record a gif that explains what bucse does
- verbose / non verbose logging
- refactor: extract parts of bucse.c into fuse_operations.c
- -Wall

- handle addToDynArray failures
(at this point we should have working MVP -- with local destination and no encryption
- improve local destination by applying a filesystem hook to be notified about changes in the filesystem
- s3 destination
- implement tests
- implement undo actions
